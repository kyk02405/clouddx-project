# CovaEX Antigravity Rules (NO CODE IN CHATGPT - Claude will code)

1. Always follow Prettier/Formatter rules for any code changes.
2. Ask for permission before installing any new library/dependency.
3. Answer concisely, but never omit required deliverables/checklists.
4. Never commit secrets. Use env files (.env.example) + secret manager/IRSA in infra.
5. Any PR must include: What/Why/How to test + Jira Issue key.
6. For protected pages/actions: enforce auth guard (unauth -> redirect /login).
7. Keep architecture split:
   - Real-time market data path (speed-first) must not block order path.
   - Order/portfolio path (consistency-first) must be transactional.
8. Prefer incremental MVP:
   - Main page first, then login, then coin detail mock, then portfolio.
